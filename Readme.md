# Robotworld continued

This is a continued version of [GamingComet](https://mods.factorio.com/user/GamingComet)'s [Robot World](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/robotworld). I have made a seperate mod because the original mod was not getting 0.18 version support. This mod will be removed if the original author requests it or the original mod gets updates.

# Credits

* All original code/concepts credits goes to [GamingComet](https://mods.factorio.com/user/GamingComet)

# Other mod support

* I only played with this for vanilla and [AAI-Industry](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/aai-industry). I will try to add other mods if requested or needed as I play with other mods. Note that I am new to modding and the lua language so I may have difficulties adding other mods with specific robot related tech.
